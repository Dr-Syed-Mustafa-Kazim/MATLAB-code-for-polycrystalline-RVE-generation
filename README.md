Author: Dr. Syed Mustafa Kazim (Ph.D., IIT Kanpur)

A MATLAB code is written to implement a novel algorithm for generating a 3D Voronoi tessellated polycrystalline RVE microstructure for Ti-alloys in which the primary-$\alpha$ grains are made to nucleate at the triple points and grain boundaries of the transformed-$\beta$ colonies. The generated microstructure retains the experimentally observed ratio of sizes and volume fraction of the primary-$\alpha$ grains and transformed-$\beta$ colonies. The algorithm assigns Euler angles and also distributes the two phases randomly to the grains in the RVE. It works by importing the mesh details from the ABAQUS input file and then forming the two kinds of grain clusters out of the RVE elements. This code is generic and can be extended to generate a similar 3D Voronoi tessellated polycrystalline RVE microstructure for any other material system.

The novel MATLAB code is uploaded on GitHub on the following path and can be availed without any charges:
