# MATLAB-code-for-polycrystalline-RVE-generation
Author: Dr. Syed Mustafa Kazim (Ph.D., IIT Kanpur)

This MATLAB code is written to generate a 3D Voronoi tessellated polycrystalline RVE microstructure. This novel algorithm is a part of my Ph.D. work in which the primary-alpha grains are made to nucleate at the triple points and grain boundaries of the transformed-beta colonies for Ti-alloys. It imports the ABAQUS input file and allocates the two phases randomly to the grains in the RVE. In addition, it assigns the Euler angles to the grains and the colonies. This code can be extended to generate a similar 3D Voronoi tessellated polycrystalline RVE microstructure for any other material system.
